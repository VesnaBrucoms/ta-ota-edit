        <h2>The Map Section</h2>
        <p><img class="image" src="images/map_overview.png" alt="The Map section" width="480" /></p>
        <p>
            The map section contains six fields: name, players, size, memory, planet, and description. Five of these fields will only ever be used when selecting the 
            map in skirmish or multiplayer.
        </p>
        <h3>Name</h3>
        <p>
            The map's name. This will be displayed when selecting the map in skirmish or multiplayer. It <i>may</i> also be used by campaigns, but the Core Contingency 
            missions leave the field blank and they have no issues.
        </p>
        <h3>Players</h3>
        <p>
            The different number of players the map can support. For example, for a four player map you would put "2, 3, 4". This will only be displayed when selecting 
            the map in skirmish or multiplayer.
        </p>
        <h3>Size</h3>
        <p>
            The map's size in 512x512 pixels. Like the players field, this is only displayed when selecting the map in skirmish or multiplayer.
        </p>
        <h3>Memory</h3>
        <p>
            The recommended system RAM to play the map. Unless you are still using a PC from the late 90s/early 2000s, this field can be ignored. Like with players and 
            size, it is only ever used when selecting the map in skirmish or multiplayer.
        </p>
        <h3>Planet</h3>
        <p>
            What planet type the map is. This is only used by campaigns to determine which rotating planet sprite to display.
        </p>
        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            The map's short description. As with before, used when selecting the map. Can be up to 128 characters; while there are a few unofficial patches that increase 
            it slightly, OTA Edit limits you to the vanilla length.
