        <p>
            The map section fields are mostly for descriptive purposes, and you can actually leave these blank and the map will still run fine. A good set of examples 
            are the Core Contingency campaign missions. The six fields are: name, players, size, memory, planet, and description. Five of these fields will only ever 
            be used when selecting the map in skirmish or multiplayer.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Name</b><br/>The map's name. This will be displayed when selecting the map in skirmish or multiplayer.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Players</b><br/>The different number of players the map can support. For example, for a four player map you would put "2, 3, 4". This will only be 
            displayed when selecting the map in skirmish or multiplayer. It does not actually control or limit the number of players.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Size</b><br/>The map's size in 512px<sup>2</sup>. Like the players field, this is only displayed when selecting the map in skirmish or multiplayer.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Memory</b><br/>The recommended system RAM to play the map. Unless you are still using a PC from the late 90s/early 2000s, this field can be ignored. Like 
            with players and size, it is only ever used when selecting the map in skirmish or multiplayer. You have a selection to choose from, or you can type in your 
            own.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Planet</b><br/>What planet type the map is. This is only used by campaigns to determine which rotating planet sprite to display. You can pick any of the 
            vanilla planet types from the drop down box, or you can type in your own.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Description</b><br/>The map's short description. As with before, used when selecting the map. Can be up to 128 characters; while there are a few unofficial 
            patches that increase it slightly, OTA Edit limits you to the vanilla length.
